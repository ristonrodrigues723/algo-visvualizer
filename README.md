Project Overview:

This repository contains the source code for a collection of web-based visualizers that demonstrate various sorting algorithms in an interactive manner. Users can input numbers, generate random arrays, and visualize the sorting process step-by-step.

Features:

Array Manipulation: Users can add and remove numbers from the array.
Random Array Generation: Generates random arrays of specified size.
Sorting Algorithm Visualization: The visualizers animate different sorting algorithms, highlighting comparisons and swaps.
Performance Metrics: Displays the number of comparisons and swaps made during the sorting process.
User Interaction: Users can control the sorting process and observe the step-by-step execution.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the website elements.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, data manipulation, and visualization of the sorting algorithms.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithm-visualizers.git
Use code with caution.

Open in a Web Browser: Navigate to the desired sorting algorithm's index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Usage:

Add or Remove Numbers: Use the input fields and buttons to add or remove numbers from the array.
Generate Random Array: Click the "Generate Random Array" button to create a random array.
Run Sorting Algorithm: Click the appropriate button to start the visualization. The visualizer will animate the sorting process, highlighting comparisons and swaps.
Observe Performance: The "Stats" section displays the number of comparisons and swaps made during the sorting process.
visual representation of multiple algorithms using js ,html and css. each algo can be accessed through the navbar and can be interacted with through given buttons.
