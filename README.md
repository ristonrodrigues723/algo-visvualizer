DSA Visualizer

This is a web-based interactive platform designed to help users learn and explore Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through visual representations and animations.

Key Features:

Interactive Visualizations: Witness algorithms like sorting, searching, and backtracking come to life with step-by-step animations.
Data Structure Exploration: Delve into various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more, with interactive visualizations.
Multiple Algorithms: Explore a wide range of algorithms including sorting (Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Radix Sort, Counting Sort, Selection Sort), searching (Linear Search, Binary Search), and backtracking (N-Queens, Knight's Tour, etc.).
User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive interface allows you to easily interact with the visualizer, manipulate data, and control the visualization speed.
Learning Resources: Access supplementary resources like explanation articles and links to external references for a deeper understanding of each concept.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
Open in Browser: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Explore and Learn: Navigate through the different sections and interact with the visualizations to gain insights into DSA concepts.
Visualizer Structure:

The visualizer is organized into various sections:

Hero Section: Provides a high-level introduction to the platform and its purpose.
Features Section: Highlights the key functionalities of the visualizer.
Interactive Visualizer Section: Serves as an entry point to explore different data structures and algorithms.
Data Structures Section: Offers detailed explanations and interactive visualizations of various data structures.
Algorithms Section: Provides a categorized list of algorithms with interactive visualizations and explanations.
About Us Section: Introduces the development team and their vision for the project.
Contribute Section: Encourages users to contribute to the project's growth.
Footer: Includes copyright information and links.
